   <h3>e.target:</h3> 

e.target refers to the element that triggered the event.
When an event occurs (e.g., a click, mouseover, keypress), it propagates through the DOM tree, and e.target represents the specific element that initiated the event.
It's particularly useful when you want to know which specific element within a container triggered the event, especially in cases where event delegation is employed.

    <h3>this: </h3>
    this refers to the context in which the current code is executing.
In the context of event handlers, this usually refers to the element to which the event handler is attached.
However, the value of this can change depending on how a function is called. It might not always point to the element you expect, especially when dealing with callbacks or methods.
It's commonly used within object methods to refer to the current instance of the object.
